# CS-330-Concepts-of-Programming-Languages

Racket projects: Solution to assignments intended to be an introduction to functional programming principles like tail-end recursion, pure functions, immutability, first-class functions, anonymous functions, higher order functions, decorators, as well as the map, filter, and fold functions. Includes Python tests.

Julia projects: Assignments intended to be an introduction to Julia and multiple dispatch as well as understanding how interpreters work and how to implement error handling. The programming language has syntax similar to Racket (or Lisp) and has support for arithmetic functions, conditional statements, type checking, variable binding, and anonymous functions. The TransInt directory also allows for a more robust `and` and `+` function that accept more than 2 arguments (syntactic sugar).

Prolog projects: Introductory assignments for the Prolog language and understanding logic programming. Includes a solution to two logic puzzles and a Sudoku solver program.

Elixir projects: Assignments intended to be an introduction to Elixir, including servers and supervisor trees.

Haskell projects: Introductory assignment for the Haskell language and lazy evaluation.

Elm projects: Assignment to introduce you to Elm and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs). Creates a Tic-Tac-Toe Web app using Elm.
